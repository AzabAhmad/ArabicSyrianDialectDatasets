### ArabicSyrianDialectDatasets
This repository contains datasets in Syrian Arabic Dialect, designed to support research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as topic detection and sentiment analysis.

Currently, two datasets are planned for release:

- Syrian Dialect Topic Detection Dataset

- ASASy: Sentiment Analysis Corpus of Syrian Dialect Facebook Posts

Each dataset will be organized in a separate folder with its own documentation, description, and usage instructions.
